4010 Group Project Progress Report (Nov 15)

Group 11: Sphere Wars

Progress of group members in past two weeks:
Each group member has been creating a plan for a reinforcement learning model to implement.
Once these plans are completed by each group member, we will implement them and have four RL models to compare.
Please see the folder RL_model_plans/ to see each plan.

Briana:
- Created plan for a Q-Learning model with Function Approximation that uses self-play (commit 67e1d5d)
Kiara:
- Created plan for a Deep Q-Network model that uses self-play (commit c1d4361).
Usman:
- Created a plan for __
Isen:
- Created a plan for __

Plan for the next two weeks:
- Complete RL model plans
- Implement these RL models
- Compare the four models
