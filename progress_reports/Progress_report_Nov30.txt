4010 Group Project Progress Report (Nov 30)

Progress of group members in past two weeks:
Each group member has implemented and trained their own RL model.
We plan to have the demo ready Nov 28th.

Briana:
- Switched from Q-learning with FA to Actor-Critic with FA model 
- Updated the RL plan for Actor-Critic
- Implemented an Actor-Critic model and the training script
- Trained and evaluated the Actor-Critic model against a random agent
- Cleaned up environment code, and abstracted constants/hardcoded values for better readability and consistency
- Enhanced environment observations so that agent can perceive more of the environment
Kiara:
- Implemented a Deep Q-Network (commit 103a5a2).
- Trained the DQN (commit __).

Plan for the next two weeks:
