4010 Group Project Progress Report (Nov 30)

Group 11: Sphere Wars

Progress of group members in past two weeks:
Each group member has implemented and trained their own RL model.
We plan to have the demo ready Nov 30th.

Briana:
- Switched from Q-learning with FA to Actor-Critic with FA model 
- Updated the RL plan for Actor-Critic (commit 8f96de6, fd49c18)
- Implemented an Actor-Critic model and the training script (commit 555077f, 8f96de6)
- Trained and evaluated the Actor-Critic model against a random agent (commit 8f96de6)
- Cleaned up environment code, and abstracted constants/hardcoded values for better readability and consistency (commit 24831fe)
- Implmented specifying agent model used for players of the game in play_game (commit 24831fe)
- Enhanced environment observations so that agent can perceive more of the environment (commit 78a0f3e)
- Create slides for results demo and filmed my portion of the demo video
Kiara:
- Implemented a Deep Q-Network (commit 103a5a2).
- Trained the DQN (commit 6062829).
- Filmed my portion of the demo.
Usman:
- Implemented DynaQ+ (Commit af3b20d)
- Simplified DynaQ+ State Encoder (As The First Implementation Was Too Complex To Revisit Any Particular State)
- Created Training Script For DynaQ+ (Vs Random and Frozen Snapshot of Agent)
- Created Wrapper Class For Agent in order to achieve encapsulation
- Added Small Reward for Successful Spawn
- Edited all the demo components together to make one final demo video
Isen:
- 

Plan for the next two weeks:
- Finish comparing the RL models.
- Write the final report.
