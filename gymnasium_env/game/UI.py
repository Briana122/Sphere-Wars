# PlayerUI Class:
# This Class displays information about an individual player in the game.
# To use this class, you will need to create an instance of PlayerUI for each player.
# If you wish, you may customize the font, colors, margin, background color, and text color to your liking.
# Otherwise, call it as is and it will use the defaults.
# Afterwards, you can call any of the draw funtions that you want, depending on what information you need.
